# BellyButton BioDiversity 

## Project Overview

In this module we learnt to use  Plotly.js, a JavaScript data visualization library, to create an interactive data visualization for the web. 

The purpose of this project is to create an interactive dashboard to explore the Belly Button Biodiversity dataset, which catalogs the microbes that colonize human navels.

The dataset reveals that a small handful of microbial species (also called operational taxonomic units, or OTUs, in the study) were present in more than 70% of people, while the rest were relatively rare.
